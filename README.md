## Dynamic Memory Management Visualizer 

## Overview
A Dynamic Memory Management Visualizer serves as an instrument for developers to comprehend and assess the allocation, utilization, and release of memory in real-time throughout program execution. These visualizers offer graphical depictions of heap memory, stack memory, and allocated objects, assisting in the debugging process and enhancing memory efficiency.

## Problem statement 
A Memory Management Visualization Tool is designed to offer a thorough simulation environment for grasping essential memory management strategies such as paging, segmentation, and virtual memory. This tool empowers users to create tailored memory allocation scenarios, allowing them to observe the operation of diverse techniques in real time. By utilizing dynamic visualization, users will be able to see the processes of memory allocation, access, and replacement within a system. The tool will incorporate interactive features that enable users to adjust memory size, designate processes, and observe the occurrences and resolutions of page faults. Furthermore, it will facilitate the analysis of replacement algorithms like First-In-First-Out (FIFO) and Least Recently Used (LRU), illustrating the impact of these methods on memory efficiency. 
 
Moreover, this system will function as an educational and analytical resource for students, researchers, and software developers aiming to enhance their knowledge of memory management. It will present step-by-step animations demonstrating the processes of memory block allocation and deallocation, as well as the approach to managing fragmentation. Visualizations of page faults and memory swaps will aid users in understanding the effects of various replacement algorithms in practical scenarios. In addition, enabling user-defined inputs will allow individuals to experiment with different memory configurations, making it an essential resource for performance assessment. By simulating intricate memory management techniques in a user-friendly and interactive format, this tool will connect theoretical understanding with practical application, thereby improving conceptual clarity and decision-making in system architecture.
